# React + Vite

## About this project

This is a simple React todo list app built by following the official MDN tutorial:  
[React todo list tutorial on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/React_todo_list_beginning)

The project helped me understand React components, props, state, and conditional rendering.
